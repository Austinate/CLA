# Contributor License Agreement for Lyft's open source projects

To contribute to any of Lyft's open source projects it's necessary to accept the
Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The process for signing is as easy as
contributing to one of the projects. Please do the following steps:

1. Read the [CLA](https://github.com/lyft/CLA/blob/master/CLA.md)
2. Fork the CLA repository.
3. Clone your fork, and create a new branch.
4. Edit CONTRIBUTORS.md, and add your name and email address to the list.
5. Commit your change (your git username and email address must match the name
   and email address added to the line in CONTRIBUTORS.md).
6. Push your change and create a pull request against the master branch of this
   repo.

Once your pull request is merged, you're approved to make contributions to any
Lyft open source project in GitHub.
